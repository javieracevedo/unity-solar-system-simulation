# Unity Solar System Simulation


Solar System Simulation project from the coursera course: introduction to Game Development Michigan State University. 
My version is a bit different from the original, it has background music and a simple UI from a unity tutorial and 
other resources.


*Here's a picture of the very simple lsimulation system:*

It was pretty fun project that helped get familiar with the unity UI and it;s tools, most of 
the code was provided by the course, except for the UI menu.
